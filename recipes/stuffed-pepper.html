      <p>Makes 8 servings</p>

      <h2>Ingredients</h2>

      <h3>Sauce:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>½ cup sour cream</li>
          <li>¼ cup salsa verde</li>
          <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro</li>
        </ul>
      <br>
      <h3>Potatoes:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>4 russet potatoes, peeled and chopped</li>
          <li>8 poblano peppers</li>
          <li>8 slices bacon</li>
          <li>½ red bell pepper, diced</li>
          <li>½ onion, diced</li>
          <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
          <li>½ cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
          <li>½ cup milk</li>
          <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
        </ul>

      <h2>Directions</h2>

      <ol>
        <li>Mix sour cream, salsa verde, and cilantro together in a bowl 
        until sauce is evenly mixed; refrigerate.</li>

        <li>Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; 
        bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, 
        about 10 minutes. Drain and cool in a large bowl.</li>

        <li>Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat 
        the oven's broiler. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and place 
        peppers on the baking sheet.</li>

        <li>Cook under the preheated broiler until the skin of the peppers 
        has blackened and blistered, 3 to 4 minutes. Place blackened peppers 
        into a bowl and tightly seal with plastic wrap. Allow peppers to steam 
        as they cool, about 20 minutes.</li>

        <li>Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, 
        turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Reserve 
        1 tablespoon bacon grease in the skillet. Drain bacon slices on paper 
        towels and chop.</li>

        <li>Combine red bell pepper, onion, and garlic in the skillet with 
        reserved bacon grease; cook and stir over medium heat until vegetables 
        are softened, 4 to 6 minutes.</li>

        <li>Mix 1/2 of the bacon, red bell pepper mixture, Cheddar cheese, 
        milk, and butter into the potatoes; mash until well blended.</li>

        <li>Remove skins from the roasted poblano peppers. Make a small 
        cut in each pepper and scrape out seeds. Stuff peppers with potato 
        mixture and top with remaining bacon and sauce.</li>
      </ol>
