      <p>A thick, rich potato soup that is both high in calories and flavor.</p>
      <p> This is a great party meal that serves about 8 people.</p>

      <h2>Ingredients</h2>

      <ul>
          <li>1 pound bacon, chopped</li>
          <li>2 stalks celery, diced</li>
          <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
          <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
          <li>8 potatoes, peeled and cubed</li>
          <li>4 cups chicken stock, or enough to cover potatoes</li>
          <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
          <li>Â¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
          <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon dried tarragon</li>
          <li>3 teaspoons chopped fresh cilantro</li>
          <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Directions</h2>
      <ol>
      <li>In a Dutch oven, cook the bacon over medium heat until done. 
        Remove bacon from pan, and set aside. Drain off all but 1/4 cup 
        of the bacon grease.</li>
      <br>
      <li>Cook celery and onion in reserved bacon drippings until onion is
        translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in garlic, and continue cooking 
        for 1 to 2 minutes. Add cubed potatoes, and toss to coat. Saute 
        for 3 to 4 minutes. Return bacon to the pan, and add enough chicken 
        stock to just cover the potatoes. Cover, and simmer until potatoes 
        are tender.</li>
      <br>
      <li>In a separate pan, melt butter over medium heat. Whisk in flour. 
        Cook, stirring constantly, for 1 to 2 minutes. Whisk in the heavy 
        cream, tarragon, and cilantro. Bring the cream mixture to a boil, 
        and cook, stirring constantly, until thickened. Stir the cream 
        mixture into the potato mixture. Puree about 1/2 the soup, and 
        return to the pan. Adjust seasonings to taste.</li>
    </ol>
